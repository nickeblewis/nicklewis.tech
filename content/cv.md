**Save the Children, London**

I have been working with an agile team of contract developers for STC in their Farringdon offices for 4 days each week and from my own office in Farnborough the remaining day. The work I have done there has been a real mix but I’d say mostly I have worked with PHP.  

Heavily involved in the build for the new Donate Hub:

Plus have done a lot of work on their Paypal payments system including the introduction of a new in-context checkout facility.

Summary of skills used

*	JQuery
*	HTML, SASS & CSS
*	RWD
*	LAMP
*	AWS S3
*	Linux
*	Jira (Agile)
*	Yii, Drupal & Wordpress
*	XSLT
*	Photoshop
*	Paypal express checkout


**GiveSmart, Reading, Berks**
*May 2015 - Oct 2015*

GiveSmart are a company who have developed a product for the charity sector that helps bring a new level of innovation to auction events. Their product can be set up at charity events where a fundraising auction is taking place. It comprises of a live server that doesn’t need the internet, it is it’s own wifi hub and data service. Phones and tablets are distributed around the tables of the event and are used to make bids on items. A larger display is used by the Auctioneer to represent a leaderboard of highest bids. It generates a competitive atmosphere amongst the guests to bid and raise as much money for the nominated charities as possible.

My role here was initially to take over from a permanent member who was leaving. I carried on from where he left off working on an Angular mobile web app which will then lead onto a new project the company has planned.

Secondly I helped develop part of an iOS (Objective-c) application that reads QR codes using the AVFoundation library. All iOS devices have cameras and these can double up as barcode/QR code readers. So I had to research how this works and get it to happen. I succeeded! Obj-C is one of my lesser used skills in the commercial space and I would like to look more into this, Swift, React Native and other native development matters.

Summary of skills used

*	Angular
*	Bootstrap 3
*	JQuery
*	SASS/CSS
*	HTML5
*	Objective-C
*	RWD
*	QR
*	PHP (Laravel 5)

**Gladstone MRM, Wallingford, Oxon**
*UI Consultant, Wallingford, Oxfordshire*
*October 2014 – March 2015*


One of Gladstone’s web products called “Connect” was developed quite a few years ago in the Microsoft stack, a combination of .NET and Web Forms and for some time it has been used by many of their customers. 

Connect is an application that is made available via login to leisure club members, so that they can book slots for the sports that they participate in. It allows them to pay for their bookings online and helps them manage their activities. 

Recently one of Gladstone’s key clients commented on that it doesn’t work well when viewed on mobile devices. They realised that this is something that would need to be addressed but they didn’t have the resources in-house to develop such a solution.

This is where I have come in to transform the product into one which does work on mobile devices without sacrificing any of it’s current functionality on the desktop. Primarily my task has been to update it’s UI by mixing in Bootstrap 3 functionality so that the website can now be used on mobile. A very challenging project bearing in mind that the decision was taken not to re-develop the product from the ground up but to modify the current code-base. 

Summary of skills used

*	Tortoise SVN
*	Bootstrap 3
*	JQuery
*	LESS/CSS
*	HTML5
*	C#
*	RWD 

**The AA, Basingstoke, Hants**
*AngularJS Developer, Basingstoke, Hampshire*
*March 2014 – October 2014 (6 months)*


When I started with the AA they were just adopting the Agile methodology but weren’t using Jira at first, this was introduced in the first couple of months of me being there. I had some experience of the practice previously so that helped me understand what they were going through. It takes time to get used to it, a big change for any company to undertake. So it was interesting being involved in this transition and seeing the benefits of daily scrums taking shape and how the team could see the benefits from the very start. 

The first project I was involved with there had only just begun, “Windscreens“ was both a mobile and desktop web app (almost responsive) with a clean and easy to follow journey based around allowing you to select which piece of glass had been damaged, the size of the damage and then your details. This results in your details being relayed on to a call centre who would then call you and confirm when a patrol would be able to visit you and carry out the repair.

You can see it in action via https://www.theaa.com/windscreen/

I then worked briefly on “mobile road” an existing app, to help with the work that needed doing for the AA’s summer campaign, codenamed “Olivia”. Part of this project included the offer of 15 months for the price of 12. This required some extra data plus logic being added so that in the future such offers could be more readily added in less time. Some HTML needed editing around these new deals in order to make sure the right message was begin conveyed in the user journey.

Finally I worked on their “Home Membership” project, part of the AA’s diversification into other markets and the services they offer for boiler repair and breakdown cover in the event of your heating system breaking down at home. This time around, I was the only JS developer working on it and also helped the two HTML/CSS/SASS Designers get to grips with Grunt, Git, Jenkins and so on. Our Scrum Master was often asking me about the technicalities,simply because he was really interested in how it all works. I enjoyed doing that as much as writing the code and this was commented on by the team and the management alike. So left a good impression on those people and I was commended for doing so.

This project was entirely responsive and it’s architecture different to the Windscreen project I had worked on previously. It was completed just before my 6 month contract came to an end.

Summary of skills used for all of the work I did with the AA

*	Git - git extensions, Bash
*	Jenkins/Gerrit
*	AngularJS for all 3 of the projects I worked on
*	RESTful Ajax requests
*	Node and NPM
*	Grunt, Maven, Karma/Jasmine Unit Testing

** Other previous contracts **

* B&Q
* Avvio Reply
* Estee Lauder
* UK Broadband
