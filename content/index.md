> Hi there.

I am a web developer who works on a contract and/or freelance basis for clients and you can learn more about what I do and indeed have done in the past via the CV Page on this site.

I am based in Farnborough, Hampshire, UK and have my own office that I rent at [Ferneberga House](http://pureoffices.co.uk/farnborough/), the former town hall and a lovely piece of local architecture. It is a great community to be a part of and I often work on projects for other businesses who are fellow tenants of mine.

Just testing that github pushes work!
