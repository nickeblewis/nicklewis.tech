> Hi there.

Head4code is a *coding agency*, something new that I have invented, as the web becomes more sophisticated businesses should be leveraging as many online services as they can in order to be successful and stay ahead of their competitors.

We are forever keeping an eye on new ways of doing things, new technology and advising on what people should be using to drive their web presence whether it is for their main site or smaller campaign based initiatives.

H4C consists of 2 guys here in Farnborough and a bunch of others spread around the World. We use services such as BitBucket and GitHub to collaborate and build fantastic wen experiences for our users.

This website is more than just a *brochure* for our services, it is a living and breathing piece of documentation that will help us all to collaborate and make better sense of the World in which we live and see through the modern web. 

We can help individuals and businesses alike build static sites blah blah, I am losing the thread hereand need to work this out better.
