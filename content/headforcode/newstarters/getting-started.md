**Your Desk**

**Your PC**

Should all be ready for you...

**Windows, OSX and Ubuntu**
**Linux**
**VM**
**Vagrant**
**Scotch Box and others**
**Sublime Text, Atom, Web Storm, PHP Storm Brackets**

All of the above are software packages that help you write code essentially. However please be aware that there are two types of app which may not be immediately obvious as being different. The two types are Text Editor and IDE, so what is the difference?

Let me explain...

A Text editor is no different in reality to Notepad (or Notepad++) if you've ever used either of those. They do have some extra features above and beyond basic editing and manipulation of text in any document at any time.

An IDE on the other hand combines many more features into the system, such as a Terminal, Version Control and so much more that it warrants an article of it's own. IDEs will always aim to incorporate as much as possible so that you need not use any other aplications (almost).

Generally speaking you should be making use of normal Text Editors, that is allyou need to begin with.

**Photoshop/Sketch**
One of the first.....
