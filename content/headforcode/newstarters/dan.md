> Welcome to Head4Code.com

Welcome to this very small team!  

I am sure you will enjoy working here and you will learn a great deal. The team will grow in time and I shall tell you more about how this will happen in a bit.

This business is going through a little bit of a transformation at the moment. I originally started Nick Lewis Ltd 6 years ago but before that I ran a company called NL Solutions Ltd, I had to wind that one up when I became unwell, as you will probably know. Cutting a long story short, I went back into business in 2010, so in total I have been in this industry for a very long time and have worked for myself since 2001. 

My Company up until now has been built upon contracting work, where I work on site for various businesses, big and small for 3 months at a time, occasionally for longer. See my [CV page](/cv) for more details of the places where I've worked.

It dawned on me a little while back that with all of this experience, I could start something new through my business and I came to call it "Head for Code" or in terms of it's web domain [head4code.com](). H4C main purpose would be to help people learn how to code and also learn how to run their own servers and that kind of thing.

Since you are yourself new to a lot of this and learning, I thought that you would be a great person to try this all out on!!!

So Head4Code.com as a website will become a large resource of courses that can be interlinked to help people learn about various aspects of Web Development.

**Getting you started**

Lets begin by having a look at what you will be learning here over the coming weeks, months and more. We shall also be taking into account what you need to be doing in order to satisfy your apprenticeship course and to do well at that. You have our full support behind you:

**The Team**

The company at the moment consists of 3 people, Tina, myself and now you too. We will also be working with some partners from around the World and the web! Some of these people will be more local though but none of them are employees, they are freelance contributors whom invoice us for their time. We bill that onto the respective end-client.

**Ferneberga House**

Ferneberga is managed by Pure Offices Ltd and two of their staff are always available on-site during core business hours. You will get to meet Dawn and Gemma in due course and you shall get on fine with them. They are always happy to help if you need anything at all, especially if I am not around.

There are toilet and kitchen facilities on each floor that you may use. Tea, coffee, milk and water is available throughout the building for no extra charge. So help yourself :-)

**Our Office**

You have 24hr/7days a week access to Suite 1.4 with both your access card and door key. 

**Desk and PC**

You are more than welcome to bring in your own computer if you wish, though we will nee to install stuff on it for you to be able to do the work that we do. There are a couple of spare Windows machines in the office and a free desk for your use. You may leave stuff in the office if you wish, it is safe when we lock up at the end of each day. 

**Contact Numbers**

* 07747 792440 my mobile
* xxxxxxx direct line to this office
* 01252 549569 my home number
* xxxxxxx main reception desk number for Ferneberga House

**Our neighbours Bespoke Insurance**

I shall introduce you to them at some point in time, they are a really nice bunch and are able to look after you if I am out for a period of time. We shall work out whether you prefer to work from Suite 1.4 or sit in with Bespoke during those times.

**What you'll be doing**

We have a few clients right now and I am actively marketing to pull in more business, so when you start it will be fairly quiet but that is not a bad thing because that will give you time to learn various things and to help out generally.

**The Apprenticeship**

TODO - just need to write up a plan for how we take this into account

**Pay**

We will have you setup on our payroll by the time you join and you will be paid on the 25th of every month.
